# bt-builder

This is prototype code for building a behaviour tree from examples of expert behaviour.
This code is explained in the accompanying paper to be made available [here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/research/gameai/publications.php) soon.

To run, this code requires:
 - [MEME Suite v4.10.0_4](http://meme-suite.org/doc/download.html) modified to allow for larger alphabets (modifications included here).
 - [XStream v1.4.7](https://x-stream.github.io/) for serialisation of trees.
 - Apache Commons IO and Collections.

As it is currently set up to work with Starcraft data, it also requires:
 - Starcraft gameplay traces as [recorded](http://scidrive.uoa.auckland.ac.nz/gameai/) by [ScExtractor](https://github.com/phoglenix/ScExtractor).
 - A JDBC driver to read the Starcraft databases.
 - [JNIBWAPI v1.0](https://github.com/JNIBWAPI/JNIBWAPI/releases/tag/v1.0) for Starcraft data handling (included here).
